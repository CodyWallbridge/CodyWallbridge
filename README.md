## 🧑‍🏫 About Me

I took a non-traditional path into software. Before tech, I spent over a decade in industrial roofing and earned my Level 1 Automotive Technician certification with honors.  
Those early roles gave me a practical, analytical mindset I still bring to development today.

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science (with a Minor in Philosophy) from the University of Manitoba.  
My industry experience covers frontend, backend, and data work at companies like:

- **Wawanesa Insurance**  
- **iQmetrix**  
- **LibreStream**  
- **QDoc**  
- **Activate Games**

Outside of industry, I build things for fun—from **Unity games** to **World of Warcraft add-ons**.

Today, I'm a **Post-Secondary Instructor at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology**, where I design scenario-based assignments, build and debug demo applications, and help students hit real-world expectations.  
I’m also part of the team leading a full program redesign, working with industry to modernize the curriculum.

My goal—whether coding or teaching—is always the same:  
**build things that are practical, ethical, and impactful.**

## 💡 What Inspires Me

I’m motivated by helping people grow.  
Watching a student go from *“I don’t get this”* to shipping their first working feature is one of the most rewarding experiences in the world.

I care a lot about thoughtful engineering, clever problem-solving, and building tools that make life easier. I’m always learning, improving, and trying to write code—and teach in a way—that genuinely helps people.
